# Liam's Civilization

## Building

The two big dependencies are ggez and imgui.

ggez build requirements:
https://github.com/ggez/ggez/blob/master/docs/BuildingForEveryPlatform.md

imgui build requirements:
https://github.com/Gekkio/imgui-rs

Basically, on Windows you should be using the MSVC ABI version of Rust.

After all the requirements are ready:
```sh
cargo run
```
